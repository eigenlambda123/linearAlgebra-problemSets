# Linear Algebra Problem Sets – Based on Gilbert Strang’s *Introduction to Linear Algebra*

This repository contains my organized solutions and study notes for *Linear Algebra* based primarily on **Gilbert Strang’s** textbook, *Introduction to Linear Algebra*. It serves as a personal study log and problem set archive as I work through core linear algebra concepts and example problems to deepen my intuition and technical fluency.

## Resource Used

All problems and theory are taken from:
**Gilbert Strang, Introduction to Linear Algebra, 5th Edition**
🔗 [https://math.mit.edu/\~gs/linearalgebra/](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/)

## Structure & Organization

Each folder corresponds to a major chapter, and within it are subfolders or files named by section numbers, following Strang’s book organization (e.g., `1.1`, `1.2`):

```

## How I'm Solving

Most problems are:

* Solved **by hand** on paper first
* Then typed in Markdown or Jupyter notebooks for future reference
* Accompanied by concise notes explaining **why** and **how** the solution works

The goal is **not speed**, but **mastery**—this is part of my long-term technical foundation building under my [Project10X Linear Algebra](https://github.com/eigenlambda123/Project10X-Linear-Algebra.git) effort.
