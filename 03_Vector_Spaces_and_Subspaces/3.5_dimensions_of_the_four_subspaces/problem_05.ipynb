    "**Matrix $B$ with $V$ as its nullspace:**\n",
    "The nullspace of $B$ should be $V$. Since $V$ is a 2-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the nullity of $B$ is 2. By the rank-nullity theorem, if $B$ is $m \\times 3$, then $\\text{rank}(B) = 3 - 2 = 1$. So $B$ should have rank 1, and its row space must be orthogonal to $V$ (since the nullspace is the orthogonal complement of the row space).\n",
